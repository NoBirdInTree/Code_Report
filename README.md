# Codes and Reports:

-- My bad. The other contributor SpyroLiu is my alt account (backup one :)

I've done some quantitative researches in courses or in my internships. 

# Papers and Writing Samples

Some papers or reports from my research introduced below are uploaded here.

G_dWOLS.pdf - (A good writing sample from my independent research project funded by ARIA) G-dWOLS Analysis of Different Fire Suppression Methods' Effectiveness on Alberta Wildfires

Cardio_Rupture.pdf - (Paper Submitted) "Inhibition of integrin αv prevents intracranial aneurysms from rupture." Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Manuscript ID: JACC-102121-4035.

Poli_Polarization.pdf - (Paper Accepted) "Online Partisan Polarization of COVID-19". 2021 International Conference on Data Mining Workshops. Paper ID: DM821.

-------------------------------------------------

## Extracurricular (internship) stuffs:

### 1. My current RA works in the biomedical field. Details should be filled in early Dec. 

### 2. G-dWOLS Analysis of Fire Suppression Methods' Effectiveness on Alberta Wildfires. (A well-written report and codes are given)

I accomplished funded independent research under Dr. Erica Moodie's supervision. I learned some methodologies in causal inference and carried out an in-depth data analysis with overlap weighting applied to regressions. The result is discussed under the framework of dynamic treatment regimens.

### 3. Political Polarization Study on Social Media during US Election Period. 

Scripts of some parts of this project are 1. Word embedding script using BERT. 2. Graphical convolution network. 3. Building up the user graph. 4. Statistical computation on the embeddings like cosine similarity, silhouette score, topics frequency as well as the entropy of the distribution. 5. Bokeh visualization. I am mainly in charge of the 1, 4, 5, and some parts of 2. One paper has been accepted by IEEE ICDM Workshop with ID: DM821.


### 4. Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker & R Dashboard. 

For the tracker, click the link (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/). If it expires, I will upload a brief recording. R dashboard codes are given.

### 5. Financial data analysis. Some daily working codes are disclosed.

-------------------------------------------------

## In-course stuffs:

#### 1.In some of my stat courses, I investigated a few datasets in the generalize linear model course and the statistical learning course at which techniques like binomial (logistic), multinomial, Poisson, quasi-Poisson, gamma regressions with F/Wald/Wilk tests, and PCA (multiple) correspondence analysis, various distance/similarity measures are used. The assignments (reports) are done using R. 

#### 2. Some content to my ongoing (commented) Bios601's homework and solutions in some math courses will also be posted. 

#### 3.In some of my CS courses, I gained experience of executing computation tasks on the environment set up on AWS and GCP (Linux System), did some data crawling, annotation, analysis, learned some classical machine learning algorithms, and practiced them on real-world datasets (in-class Kaggle competition). Here are some toy codes, which include: ---1. Scrapping data from HTML text. ---2. Implementation of Naïve Bayes and Text Classification Task on Reddit (A Famous Forum).  ---3. MINST dataset number recognition using CNN.
