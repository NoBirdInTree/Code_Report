about_text <- c("The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA): The CLSA is a longitudinal population-based study
including 51,338 participants who were aged 45 to 85 years when they were recruited from 10 Canadian
provinces (2011-2015). Each participant is re-contacted every 3 years and will be followed for at least 20
years or until death. The details of the CLSA are provided elsewhere (1). The first follow-up (2015-2018,
95% retention) is complete and the second follow-up is ongoing (2018-2021). The CLSA COVID-19 Study
was launched April 15, 2020 to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 among older Canadians.",
"The CLSA COVID-19 Study: Of the 51,338 CLSA participants, 42,700 were invited to take part in the CLSA
COVID-19 study. Of those invited, 8,633 had to be excluded because they had died (n=2,500), they had
withdrawn from the CLSA before the second follow up (n=3,406), they required help (a proxy) to
continue participation (n=318), or for administrative reasons, the most common being that current
contact information was not available (n=2,409). We used e-mail and telephone to recruit participants
into the CLSA COVID-19 Study. Participants who had active email addresses were contacted by email and
invited to participate using a questionnaire that could be completed on the internet (i.e. the Web
questionnaire (n=34,498)) and those without email access were invited by telephone to complete the
interviews over the phone (n=8,202). At the time of recruitment, the CLSA staff were also conducting
the core CLSA data collection so a private marketing company was hired to recruit the majority of the
telephone-based sample. Participants aged 70 years or older at the time of recruitment were contacted
by CLSA staff (n=2,782) and those under 70 (n=5,420) were contacted by the private marketing company.",
"Participants were informed about the purpose and scope of the study prior to agreeing to participate. 
During the recruitment process, an additional 144 participants were found to have died and 23 were 
identified as needing a proxy to arrive at the overall eligible sample of 42,511, of which 28,559 (66.9%) 
agreed to participate in the CLSA COVID-19 study.  The response rates were 23,832/34,498 (69.1%) for 
those invited by an e-mail invitation, 2,606/5,420 (48.1%) for participants contacted by telephone 
by the private marketing company, and 2,121/2,782 (76.2%) for participants contacted by telephone by 
the CLSA staff.",
"The CLSA-COVID-19 study is collecting longitudinal data (weekly/biweekly and monthly) for at least a 6-month period. All participants completed an initial 30-minute baseline questionnaire. Those completing
the internet based interview received four consecutive weekly 10 minute questionnaires, while the
Telephone group received two consecutive biweekly 10-minute questionnaires. This was followed by
three 10-minute monthly questionnaires and a final 30 minute exit questionnaire for all participants.
The baseline and final exit questionnaire captured information on COVID symptoms and status, risk
factors, healthcare use, health behaviours, psychosocial and economic consequences of the pandemic.
All other questionnaires were shorter and focussed on symptoms, COVID status, and behaviours.
Anxiety and depression were measured using the Brief Measure for Assessing Generalized Anxiety
Disorder (GAD-7) and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D-10)
respectively.",
